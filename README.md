# Musick

Musick is a (very) simple music web app that retrieves albums from a list of music artists using the [MusicBrainz](https://www.musicbrainz.org) API. After choosing an artist, you can click on the album and add it to a "favorites" list.

This project was generated using [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 20.3.9.


## Development server

Assuming you have checked out the repo and have run `npm install` inside the directory...

To start a local development server, run:

```bash
ng serve
```

Once the server is running, open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload whenever you modify any of the source files.

## Building

To build the project run:

```bash
ng build
```

This will compile your project and store the build artifacts in the `dist/` directory. By default, the production build optimizes your application for performance and speed.

## Running unit tests

To execute unit tests with the [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io) test runner, use the following command:

```bash
ng test --no-watch
```
